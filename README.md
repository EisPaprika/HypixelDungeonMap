# Hypixel Dungeon Map

An alternative for those who just want the map feature.

You need jdk8 to compile these files. Make sure JAVA_HOME is set to the jdk8 directory.

Installation
1. Download the files
2. Unpack them
3. Open the cmd
4. Move to the directory using cd (example: cd Downloads\HypixelDungeonMap-main)
5. Run "gradlew build", it might take some time
6. Move the HypixelDungeonMap.jar (inside build\lib) to your mod folder
